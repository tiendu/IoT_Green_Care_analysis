# IoT_Green_Care_analysis
This is where I got the dataset: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/green-care-dataset

The dataset is actually from a study to implement IoT in an automated farm.
In the notebook, I've implemented some feature engineering methods and modelling to predict the actuators' state.
